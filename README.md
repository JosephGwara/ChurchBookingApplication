#Church booking application
### Some background information on the purpose of this application 

#### During the pandemic in South Africa only a limited number of people where allowed to gather in a building 
#### This limited the amount of people able to attend church services for the church i go to
#### The church has an online booking system and had the number of available spots capped at the amount regulated by covid legislation 
#### This created high demand for said spots and they would be filled within seconds of them becoming available making it dificult to get a booking
#### To solve this problem I created this application to help with making a booking very quickly.
#### The application requests the users information and after the user inputs their information it opens the booking page and refreshes it every 4 seconds until the bookings are available
#### It takes less than a second to make the booking ,the manipulation of the web browser and filling in of forms is achieved by using Selenium
